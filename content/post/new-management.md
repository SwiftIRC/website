SwiftIRC is now under new ownership and management. Dragon has taken
over the network, effective immediately. 

The first priority of the new management is to mitigate the imapct the
DDoS attacks have been having on us.

Furthermore, we hope to grow the network, and upgrade it to newer software in the
coming months. As some of you may know we have been running forks
of unrealircd and anope from 2006 and we intend to change that.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to
support@swiftirc.net.

Regards,
Dragon
