Matrix and Discord relays have been provisioned!
They are both relayed through the names `Matrix` and `Discord`,
respectively. Matrix users sending messages will join the
channel as `nick[m]` whereas Discord users will rather
have their messages sent via `Discord`.

Our Discord can be found at [discord.gg/swiftirc](https://discord.gg/swiftirc).

Our Matrix can be found at matrix.swiftirc.net with a client available at [element.swiftirc.net](https://element.swiftirc.net).

We will keep our main IRC channel (#swiftirc) topic updated with this information.

Regards,

Dragon
